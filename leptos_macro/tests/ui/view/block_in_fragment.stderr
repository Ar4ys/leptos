  = help: the trait `std::ops::Fn<()>` is not implemented for `A`
  = note: wrap the `A` in a closure with no arguments: `|| { /* code */ }`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `IntoView`:
            bool
            char
            isize
            i8
            i16
            i32
            i64
            i128
          and $N others
  = note: required for `A` to implement `IntoView`
help: you might have meant to create the closure instead of a block
